          As a student, I have worked in several customer assistance - centered
          jobs but my technology-centered jobs started with an internship in
          EWORX S.A. as a Data Science Intern, in which I learned R and how to
          use it to effectively manipulate data and visualise them.{<br />}{" "}
          Additionally, I&apos;ve spent a 6 month period, working as a Junior
          Data Scientist at Zero To MVP Inc, and with a focus on learning
          JavaScript and C# / .NET, and used each of these tools to automate
          processes, as well as deliver projects with API implementations.
          {<br />} At the present time, I am working as a full time Software
          Engineer in Squaredev, sharpening my JavaScript skills with various
          frameworks and libraries, while making time to also learn some
          back-end functionality with NodeJS and API creation with FastAPI.
